/**
 * The Runner class is an abstract class referencing one or several specifications to run. It should be extended
 * with at least one runner trait which will use the <code>specifications</code>.
 * Usage:<code>
 * class mySpecRunner extends Runner(mySpec) with JUnit with Console with ScalaTest
 * or
 * class mySpecRunner extends Runner(mySpec) with JUnit with Xml with ScalaTest
 * which will also output the results in an xml file
 * <code>
 * 
 * Then mySpecRunner class can be executed in many ways:<ul>
 * <li>scala -cp ... -e "new mySpecRunner.reportSpecs"
 * <li>java -cp ... org.scalatest.Runner -g -s mySpecRunner
 * <li>java -cp ... org.junit.runner.JUnitCore mySpecRunner
 * </ul>
 * 
 * It is annotated with a JUnit annotation because JUnit requires that annotation should be placed on the class which will be executed. 
 * In the example above, Runner(mySpec) is the only class; JUnit, Console and ScalaTest are all traits.
